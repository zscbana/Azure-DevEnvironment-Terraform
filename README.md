# Terraform Basics Project

## Overview

This project is a hands-on learning experience with Terraform, where I will implement Azure resources using Visual Studio Code. My goal is to enhance my skills in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by deploying an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) and creating a redeployable environment.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of Terraform.
- Deploy Azure resources using Terraform.
- Gain experience with Visual Studio Code for development.
- Set up and configure an Azure VM that can be accessed via SSH.

## Course Details

This project is based on a tutorial by Derek Morgan. You can find more of his courses at [More Than Certified](https://morethancertified.com).

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
   - Set up an Azure account if you don't have one.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-directory
    ```

3. **Follow Along with the Tutorial**: As I implement each step, I'll update this README with insights, challenges faced, and solutions found.

## Conclusion
By completing this project, I aim to strengthen my understanding of Terraform and Azure, making me better prepared for future projects in cloud infrastructure.
